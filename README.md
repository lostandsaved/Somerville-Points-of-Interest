## Neighborhood Map Project - Somerville Points of Interest

This is a map of the downtown I live near. The points of interest are my favoriate places to eat, and an arcade.

## Usage

You can use the application one of two ways:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine and run the index.html page.

2. Visit: [Index page](https://lostandsaved.github.io/Somerville-Points-of-Interest/index.html) - Open the menu in the top left to filter points of interest. Click a marker for more information about the location.
